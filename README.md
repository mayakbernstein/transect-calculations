# transect-calculations
  This notebook contains code for calculations of percent cover of various cover types across different portions of line-intercept vegetation transects.

  The methods for this data processing rely on the input data to be formatted according to [this](insert raw data file here) excel sheet. This data processing can also be done using the [Data Processing App](https://cafdunework-monitoringplantcov.streamlit.app/#ecological-transect-data-processor)

  Detailed descriptions of the variables calculated can be found in the [column_descriptions.md](column_descriptions.md) file. 

  All work done here is for California Dune Science Network's Climate Action Fund project, working to standardize data collection and processing of vegetation sampling across coastal dune systems in California.
